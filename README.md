# ðŸ§ª Testing Manim

Manim is a Python 3.7+ module for making mathematical animations, using the inbuilt
manim classes. I'm trying to test the module out and make something interesting :O
To suggest any interesting animations, Join my discord! :D

# ðŸ”¬ Experimentation

Want to try Manim for yourself? Read the docs for the official manim project! (I would recommend you to use the community version.)
